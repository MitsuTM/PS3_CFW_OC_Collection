# PS3_CFW_OC_collection

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !

To each PS3 models their limits, so proceed step by step.

Having a hardware flasher is highly recommended if you plan to try insane OC.

1000MHz on memory = high risk of bricking.

650/850 should be good for most PS3. (Except FAT models, don't OC them).

These firmwares are mostly based on Evilnat 4.91.2 PEX beta 8 and 9 for the moment.

You can use ps3MFW-Builder if you don't find what you're searching here.
A video tutorial exist.
