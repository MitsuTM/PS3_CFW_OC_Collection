# PS3_CFW_OC_collection

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !

To each PS3 models their limits, so proceed step by step.

Having a hardware flasher is highly recommended if you plan to try insane OC.

1000MHz on memory = high risk of bricking.

650/850 should be good for most PS3 and is the recommended limit for a 65nm RSX. (Except 90nm FAT models, don't OC them at all).
700/850 is well supported by all 25XX slim and represents 90% of the gains you can get with an RSX overclock.
We've never seen a single of them not supporting these frequencies for the moment.
Going above these frequencies is up to you and at your own risks.

These firmwares are mostly based on Evilnat 4.91.2 PEX beta 8 and 9 for the moment.

You can use ps3MFW-Builder if you don't find what you're searching here.
A video tutorial exist.
