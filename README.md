USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !

To each PS3 models their limits.

1000MHz on memory = high risk of bricking.

⚠️ Some safety rules :

• DO NOT OVERCLOCK A 90NM FAT, they're already dying at 500/650.

• 650/850 should be good for most PS3 and is the recommended limit for a 65nm RSX (Some FATs models and 20XX slism).
Note that you may experience shutdowns in demanding games if your NEC Tokins are too degraded. In this case, just install lower frequencies.

• 700/850 is well supported by all 25XX slim and represents 90% of the gains you can get with an RSX overclock.
We've never seen a single of them not supporting these frequencies for the moment.
Do not install higher frequencies without knowing which RSX revision is in your console (CXD5300"A1GB", "CGB", "DGB" or "GGB", they're not equals).
Going above these frequencies blindly is up to you and at your own risks.

⚠️ Having a hardware flasher is highly recommended if you plan to be adventurous and not to stick to these recommandations.

These firmwares are mostly based on Evilnat 4.91.2 PEX beta 8 and 9 for the moment.
